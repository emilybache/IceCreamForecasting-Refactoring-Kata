IceCream Refactoring Kata
==========================

Get the code under test. These functions display some or all of these properties which make the functions hard to test:

- Missing Input
- Side Effects
- Non-deterministic

Suggested order to tackle it in:

- getScore()
- printScore()
- printScoreboard()

Address the factors that make them hard to test so that you end up testing pure functions.
